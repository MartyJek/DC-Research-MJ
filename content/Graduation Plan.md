# Info

At the end of your Minor, during Plus Weeks, you formulate a graduation plan (4ECTs). It is a dynamic working document that you can regularly consult during your graduation project process. The plan is a personal formulation of your own ambitions and ideas. It is a starting point that will change as you deepen your research and experimentation.  

Your graduation plan is consistent with your Minor and Practice. Your Minor teachers can support you with (verbal) feedback. It is up to you to determine the content and format of this plan. Like other plusweek plans, there is no formal assessment of your graduation plan. It is only marked as pass or fail. An insufficient is only given in the case where nothing is submitted.  

The following guidelines are not a set of absolute rules, but the plan should attempt to mention the following topics: 

- Self-formulated project description, preliminary research question and methodology. 
- Set up of your research, the research documentation, and its visual/temporal/spatial presentation. 
- Role of your external partner (if applicable). 
- Station(s) you will work in. 
- Technical aspects. 
- Economic aspects. 
- Societal aspects. 
- Planning and deadlines (these can be a combination of personal and formal).
