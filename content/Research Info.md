**RESEARCH DOCUMENT: research by making**

**aim**  
The aim of the research document is to contextualise and substantiate your research process behind your project. You show and discuss its contexts, your methods, experiments, your insights/findings and your conclusions. Compiling this research document also prepares you for your graduation.  

**approach  
**During the sessions, we will discuss your research process, findings and analyses as well as the connection with your project. We will discuss your references (theoretical contexts), artistic research approaches/ methods, experiments (visual, material, sensory etc)  and ways of documenting your research.

**components**  
Your research document clarifies and substantiates your research process: interpreting references and inspirations, working with certain methods and approaches, showing visual/material/spatial and other experimentation and iteration, analysing the outcomes and communicating a conclusion, including a reflection on the relation to your project.  
Give insights in your process: why you took certain steps and made decisions, based on which observations, insights and reflections. Explain and reflect your role within the collaboration.  Do not only write down WHAT you did, but also include WHY you made certain steps and decisions. Make sure you include relevant visuals of your process and clearly describe them.  

**Your research document must include:** 

- title, table of contents, name, student number and date; 
- a report of your research in text, image, video, and/or audio of approximately 3000-5000 words words or equivalent; excluding reading list, appendices and footnotes. (possibilities to be discussed with research tutors)
- Clearly defined research question and conclusion 
- Explanation of the relationship between your research and your practical work, these together form your final project; 
- a reflection on the process, iterations, decisions and the results through the lens of bias and/or power 
- a literature and reference list (min. 5). Use references in MLA style – refer to (at least some of) the texts, films, works etc that have been discussed in the course + use your own references. 
- Include extract of (at least) one interview with an external partner
