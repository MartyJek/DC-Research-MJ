*Permaculture Chicken from Bill Mollison's 'Introduction to Permaculture'*

> Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single product system. <br>
> — Bill Mollison
