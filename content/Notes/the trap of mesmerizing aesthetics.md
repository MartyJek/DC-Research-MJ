I've first heard this term from Aymeric Mansoux who lead a [[Permacomputing#Permacomputing in the Arts - Workshop 16/03/23|Permacomputing workshop]] in March.

Current existential thoughts on a probable future career as a 3D artists creating shoe-advertisements for trendy shoe brands; as well as on his presentation of techno-maximalism has brought me to problematizing my own design practices as well as the state of affairs in the current world of ICT.
