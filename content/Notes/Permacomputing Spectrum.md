___

The idea behind this first iteration of a diagram is to visualise the pluralistic world of PMC and show examples of opposing [[On Permacomputing#'Hard vs. 'Soft' Permacomputing|'Hard' vs. 'Soft' Permacomputing]] practices.

An example of opposites would be getting [[off-the-grid]] vs. [[off-the-Cloud]]
The first being a radical jump into PMC. What might be *unsound* or *impossible* for most committing to the first example, a *softer* approach, like getting their data off from Cloud services, is a realistic example of transitioning into a more biosphere-aware computational culture.
