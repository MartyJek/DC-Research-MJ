# bitart - A procedural integer art generator

Inspired by [this post](https://www.metafilter.com/192164/Patterns), bitart creates procedural art by generating a random integer function that takes the coordinates of the current pixel and produces a result that gets plotted, making some effort to reject "boring" images.

It does this without resorting to evaluating strings as Ruby code.
