Working towards an eco-conscious design practice is not only a matter of reconfiguring them or finding new ways of working, it also manifests in changes in behaviour and thought-patterns outside of work. Do I own too many things? Are my heaters set to high? Do I shower for too long? _Sometimes, my thoughts go a bit extreme:_ Shall I still use a vacuum or be satisfied with the broom? My thoughts may also turn 180, once hearing smart scientists talk about techno-progressive, accelerationist views. Can climate change only be stopped through more technology? Is degrowth not the way?

Nonetheless research and explorations in (more) sustainable design methods has heightened my sensitivity towards sustainability issues in and around my environment. I’d like to hold onto such moments and create a montage, an archive of events that grind my permacomputing-gears. Maybe an extension of an ICT-critical work like the _Crappy Everyday Tech Bingo._

I’d like to explore and flip around the meaning of _ugly_. A term that is mostly considered negative, something you want to hide from the public. In technological terms this consists of hiding complexity and locking parts away through the term Virtualism, I’ve explored in my Minor Project – the effort of hiding complexity through minimal design choices. Animation is able to create life where there is none. What if I would virtually reuse e-waste, as a character for my film?
