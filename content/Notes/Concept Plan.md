# Introduction

## Research Question

### V1

>How can you ~~define~~ **explore** a biosphere-aware techno-aesthetics in computer graphics within permacomputing design principles?


### V2

>**How can you explore eco-consciousness in computer graphics based on Permacomputing design principles?**


### V3

>**How can I explore and make aware of [[Ecomedia]] in an interactive media installation based on Permacomputing design principles**


# Goal of the Project

- **Make aware of and expose**
	- energy use in digital media e.g. content consumption
		- **through** attaching a Wattmeter in each computational component of the installation 
	- the underlying processes of media streaming
	- the overarching system of ICT maximalisation
		- **through** the medium (?)
