# Introduction

## Research Question

### V1

>How can you ~~define~~ **explore** a biosphere-aware techno-aesthetics in computer graphics within permacomputing design principles?


### V2

>How can you explore eco-consciousness in computer graphics based on Permacomputing design principles?

### V3

- Adding interactivity

>**How can I explore and make aware of eco-conscious digital aesthetics in an interactive media installation based on [[On Permacomputing#PMC Principles x Computer Graphics|Permacomputing design principles]]** ?


#### V3.1

>How can I explore and make aware of sustainable approaches in digital media through an interactive media installation?

#### V3.2

>How can you explore and make aware of sustainable approaches in computer graphics and media streaming through an interactive media installation?



# Goal of the Project

- **Make aware of and expose**
	- energy use in digital media e.g. content consumption
		- **through** attaching a Wattmeter in each computational component of the installation 
	- the underlying processes of media streaming
		- 
	- the overarching system of ICT maximalisation
		- **through** the medium (?)

*"Unlike Simondon’s techno-aesthetics, which may eventually iteratively find a pleasing equilibrium between functional technique and aesthetics, permacomputing’s techno-aesthetics are much more perilous because a third component is forced in: an informed and contextualised intention to address the social, cultural, environmental and economic externalities of maximalist computer and network technologies."*
