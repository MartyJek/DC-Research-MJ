# Abstract

Should data expire? In this essay, honor ash explores entropy and permanence in digital landscapes. How have our personal relationships to data changed as storage has shifted from the physical to the digital realm?

>In the pre-digital world, our personal data took up a lot of space. In fact, it took up exactly as much space as the thing that it was.

## [[Skeuomorphic Design]]

As storage becomes less grounded in its physicality, it’s harder to grasp what it means for a file to be ‘large’, or to keep track of just how many artefacts we’re holding on to. Part of the attempt to address this disconnection is through the use of ==skeuomorphic design.== For something to be skeuomorphic, its design must echo elements of that same object when made from another material, or used in a different context. In this case, we’re referring to digital representations of things which are familiar for their non-digital function, like a note pad, or a bin.

## Borrowing space

Cloud storage has been widely adopted, meaning we no longer have to face the reality of not physically having enough storage capacity of our own — we can always borrow more (for a price).

>Digital storage has become perceived as an infinite resource.

>The cloud is somewhere else, and any problems created by simply having too much stuff are now someone else’s problems.

 When resources are virtual, infinite, and expandable via subscription, the consequences of overconsuming are indirect and out of sight. ==We are rarely confronted with the environmental reality of our reliance on datacentres.==

## Cloud Photos

In a study commissioned by Fujifilm in March 2022 [13](http://solarprotocol.net/sunthinking/ash.html#fn13) , 97% of all adults surveyed said that they use cloud storage for some or all of their photos. Only 12% of those surveyed spend money on additional storage, and 7 out of 10 admitted to transferring old photos onto new devices without filtering or organising them in any way. The survey also queried how often participants would go back and review their collections — the average rate was only once a month.

>If these photos are truly a crutch to bolster our memory, and boost our mood, wouldn’t we spend a bit more time, well, remembering?

> Relying on cloud storage to keep memories safe

## Archives of ourselves are a historicization of our very near past

Sharing our informal collections through our own curated lens changes our image of self. We start to blur the edges between our whole, offline, flawed self, and our curated, online, idealised self.

## TAKING A SCREENSHOT IS A WAY OF LEGITIMISING SOMETHING

>‘I want to save this, and look at it later. This is important enough.’ For something to be screenshot-worthy, it’s crossed the threshold that you not only want to keep it, but you want to know where it is.

>In addition to what we capture in order to rebroadcast, screenshots take on another quality when they contribute to our collected archive of personal data. They contribute to our sense of self.

## We only have so much capacity to remember

How could we go about applying an expiry protocol to these artefacts? First, I think their erasure must be complete. Nobody, anywhere should have a copy of what was written or captured once it has expired. I think this completeness is absolutely essential in order for the erasure to have a real impact on how we feel about the things we choose to keep. I also think the period between creation and deletion needs to be long enough that you’re done with short-term processing before the data slips away. You should have had enough time to create it, think about it a little bit, come back to it, and evaluate whether or not it should be saved, but not enough time that you’re a fundamentally different person by the time you stumble back across it [30](http://solarprotocol.net/sunthinking/ash.html#fn30) .

**In a world with expiration by default in place, what would change?** On a practical level, we would get more mileage out of ==less computing power==. We’d be going ==from a disposable and greedy type of usage, a hoarding behaviour, to one which would recognise that if the box is full, you need to take something out of the box==, instead of building infinite extensions until there’s nothing left to build with. [31](http://solarprotocol.net/sunthinking/ash.html#fn31) We would have a better understanding of what informs us as people because the external framework that we rely on to assist our memory would be by nature more goopy and imperfect and rounded. We would have reintroduced a more natural entropy into a digital context, and be empowered to move on from damaging patterns of behaviour — like diving into a sprawling, decades-old message log just to prove a point or to make a pain feel fresh. [32](http://solarprotocol.net/sunthinking/ash.html#fn32)

==We’d also have a more intuitive understanding of the relationship between our actual, lived, day-to-day experience and the collected data we both choose to keep, and that which we choose to publicly present in order to represent or illustrate our whole selves.== Instead of a mass, unexamined, uncurated bulk of information about us languishing on the public internet for others to take at face value, we would have small collections of trinket, tokens and souvenirs that would imply a larger story than the item itself. If everyone was in the same boat, having our stories informed by the souvenirs we choose to save (rather than letting algorithms choose for us from a sea of everything we’ve ever seen, thought, or done) would encourage us to afford that same grace to others — the grace of acknowledging that there’s more behind the public presentation of curated trinkets, and that ==a flat profile should never be confused for the complex, expansive, whole.==
