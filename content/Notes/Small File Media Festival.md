# About 

>Why small files? Because streaming media is killing the planet! Streaming comprises a significant chunk of the world’s digital carbon footprint. Information and communication technologies as a whole cause 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions—that’s the same as the airline industry—and are rising fast. Watching small-file media together on a big screen brings the democratic potential of cinema into the digital age by showcasing artworks made with eco-friendly practices, affordable equipment, and minimal processing time (all without sacrificing artistry or immersion).

>How small is a small-file movie? No more than 1.44 megabytes per minute, the storage size of a floppy disk. (TikTok is positively bloated in comparison, at 70 megabytes per minute.)

## Aesthetic and Technical Solutions for making your own Small-File Ecomedia

### (Handbrake) Compression

>Here is how we converted a 50 second 90mb .mov file to a 1.2 MB .mp4.

1. Cap the resolution to 480p (= 480x480px in my example, normal 480p = 854X480)
2. Quality Rate Factor (RF) on 32, or lower
3. reduce framerate?
4. compress audio (mono = 50% better, mp3 codec bitrate 32kbps
