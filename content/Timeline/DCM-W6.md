**OCTOBER:  RESEARCH APPROACH**

**Week 6 (40):** **5 Oct:** **Research methods: introduction**

We will discuss several research methods and approaches and work on the set up of your research plan. Which research methods you are going to use to answer your research question? How are going to document the outcomes?  See also the research Circle (Research Station). Choose one method you would like to discuss in the group.

– **Pitch your initial ideas**: what do you want to explore and work on this semester. This is your own plan, but it should  be related to a critical view on technological systems. Include your preliminary research question and research methods.
