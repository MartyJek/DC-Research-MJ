>A portable 8-bit virtual computer

>Uxn is a small virtual machine geared towards small graphical applications, shown in figure 3, with features reminiscent of classic home computers.[48] It differs from most other fantasy platforms in its emphasis on low implementation complexity, and it has already been implemented on a variety of platforms including devices such as the Nintendo Gameboy Advance and the Raspberry Pi Pico. Uxn is being developed by Hundred Rabbits, a small artist collective living on a sailboat, as a platform for their own games and programs.
>*— [[Permacomputing Aesthetics]]*

>The Uxn/Varvara ecosystem is a **personal computing stack** based on a [small virtual machine](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn/tree/main/item/src/uxn.c) that lies at the heart of our software, and that allows us to run the same application on a variety of systems.
>
>It is designed with an [implementation-first](https://100r.co/site/weathering_software_winter.html) mindset and is tailored to our specific needs for hosting graphical applications, but is entirely open and welcomes anyone to adopt it as a release target. Uxn is programmable in its own unique [language](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html), and the distribution of Uxn programs is akin to sharing game roms for classic console emulators, to learn more, see our notes on [uxn design](https://100r.co/site/uxn_design.html).
