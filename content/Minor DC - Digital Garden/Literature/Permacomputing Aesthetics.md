>Permacomputing could therefore be an effective cultural counter-voice to a digital aesthetic that encourages maximisation, e.g. high bandwidth, high resolution, more computing power at any cost, for anything, sensing and capturing more, while making less and less sense, ultimately rendering us insensitive to the harm and damage we legitimise

# Abstract

[[Permacomputing]] is a nascent concept and a community of practice centred around ==design principles that embrace limits and constraints as a positive thing in computational culture, and on creativity with scarce computational resources.==As a result, permacomputing aims to provide a countervoice to digital practices that promote maximisation, hyper-consumption and waste. It seeks to ==encourage practices as an applied critique of contemporary computer tech-nology that privileges maximalist aesthetics== where more pixels, more frame rate, more computation and more power equals more potential at any cost and without any consequences. We believe that such a critical practice can be relevant to artists, designers and cultural practitioners working with computer and network tech-nology who are interested in engaging with environmental issues. This is particularly relevant given the tendency in art, design and cultural production to rely on tools and techniques designed to maximise productivity and mass consumption.
In this paper, we argue for the potential of ==permacomputing as a rich framework for exploring creative design constraints== building on a long history of applying constraints in art, design and cultural practices. Because of the need to reconfigure the modes of production and organisation within computational practices, this calls for a ==different understanding of aesthetics, one that goes beyond the formal evaluation of how things look, but addresses how aesthetics can also be systems of relations, sensing and making sense that are already present in the process of making.== We will also discuss the challenges faced by permacomputing practitioners, such as the complicated link with retro-computing, post-digital culture and nostalgia, as well as the problem of constraints in relation to the aesthetisation of poverty, and more generally what it means to work with self-imposed limits in a more privileged socioeconomic context.

# Reflection

In a near vengeful tone the authors of this piece strip apart the term of maximalist techno-aesthetics: "Aesthetics, that are the manifestation of technologies driven by the myth of perpetual growth and infinite resources, aesthetics based on the everincreasing complexity and resource consumption of digital devices that seek to justify growth through self-referential legitimisation, regardless of necessity or ability to even function properly". They criticize corporate greed and the idea that "new is always better". Permacomputing, a combination of the words Permaculture and computing, seeks to be a practical framework that encourages limits and constraints in computer culture and creativity. In my own practices I've fallen into the trap of 'mesmerizing aesthetics', creating beautiful (but shallow) 3D CGI artwork that goes into a similar direction of ignorant (towards Climate Crisis, overconsumption) maximisation. In the name of Permacomputing I am trying to reframe my practices into purposeful aesthetics with self-imposed constraints.

"Computationally minimal art (CMA) can be described as an algorithmic art that idealizes low computational complexity as a source of beauty." The simplicity of CMA in it's own process-making can be defined as an aesthetics
