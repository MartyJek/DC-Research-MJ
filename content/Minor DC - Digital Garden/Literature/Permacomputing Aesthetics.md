> Permacomputing could therefore be an effective cultural counter-voice to a digital aesthetic that encourages maximisation, e.g. high bandwidth, high resolution, more computing power at any cost, for anything, sensing and capturing more, while making less and less sense, ultimately rendering us insensitive to the harm and damage we legitimise

# Abstract

[[Permacomputing]] is a nascent concept and a community of practice centred around ==design principles that embrace limits and constraints as a positive thing in computational culture, and on creativity with scarce computational resources.==As a result, permacomputing aims to provide a countervoice to digital practices that promote maximisation, hyper-consumption and waste. It seeks to ==encourage practices as an applied critique of contemporary computer tech-nology that privileges maximalist aesthetics== where more pixels, more frame rate, more computation and more power equals more potential at any cost and without any consequences. We believe that such a critical practice can be relevant to artists, designers and cultural practitioners working with computer and network tech-nology who are interested in engaging with environmental issues. This is particularly relevant given the tendency in art, design and cultural production to rely on tools and techniques designed to maximise productivity and mass consumption.
In this paper, we argue for the potential of ==permacomputing as a rich framework for exploring creative design constraints== building on a long history of applying constraints in art, design and cultural practices. Because of the need to reconfigure the modes of production and organisation within computational practices, this calls for a ==different understanding of aesthetics, one that goes beyond the formal evaluation of how things look, but addresses how aesthetics can also be systems of relations, sensing and making sense that are already present in the process of making.== We will also discuss the challenges faced by permacomputing practitioners, such as the complicated link with retro-computing, post-digital culture and nostalgia, as well as the problem of constraints in relation to the aesthetisation of poverty, and more generally what it means to work with self-imposed limits in a more privileged socioeconomic context.


# 3 ART, DESIGN AND CULTURAL WORK UNDER CONSTRAINTS

## Self-imposed constraints: *Less is more*

### Examples:

- literary rules of the writers of the [OuLiPo](History of the Lipogram. In Oulipo: A Primer or Potential Literature) collective 
- [conceptual writing ]([monoskop.org/images/3/3c/Dworkin\_Craig\_Goldsmith\_Kenneth\_eds\_Against\_Expression\_An\_Anthology\_of\_Conceptual\_Writing.pdf](https://monoskop.org/images/3/3c/Dworkin_Craig_Goldsmith_Kenneth_eds_Against_Expression_An_Anthology_of_Conceptual_Writing.pdf))
- minimalism in music and visual art;
- any notated work to be performed, executed, installed, manifested again, such as poetry, music, graphic scores, conceptual art, performance art, installation art, software and computational art. [^1]
- [choice of technology used: early computer artists in the late 1960s and early 70s working out programs for plotters without screens](Zsofi Valyi-Nagy. 2022. Vera Molnar: Weaving Variations. https://www.holo.mg/ dossiers/vera-molnar-weaving-variations/)
- [subsets of the demoscene subculture that focus on making extremely small audiovisual programs or deliberately use old and limited hardware platforms](Olga Goriunova. 2011. Art Platforms and Cultural Production on the Internet. Routledge.)
- [choice of ‘poor’ materials: arte povera in Italy in the 1960s, using materials such as wood, earth, scrap metal and industrial waste; making furniture from common sizes of construction wood]( Enzo Mari. 2017. Autoprogettazione? (eight reprint ed.). Edizioni Corraini, Mantova.)
- [found industrial materials; making household objects from available small trees and branches in Slöjd.](J. Sundqvist. 2018. Slöjd in Wood. Lost Art Press LLC.)
- working with E-waste
- working with [[Low-tech magazine | limited availability of hardware and energy]]


>More generally, self-imposed constraints in this context become facilitators and amplifiers of creativity, so it is also possible to refer to them as [fabric](http://viznut.fi/texts-en/fabric_theory.html), or to [redirect the discussion](https://conditionaldesign.org/ manifesto/) by [emphasising the process](https://valiz.nl/en/publications/conditional-design-workbook).

## Political & external constraints

### Examples

- Building your own server and denying the comfort of Cloud-products
- unofficial artists during ‘normalisation’ in Czechoslovakia (1970s-1980s) and elsewhere retreated from public space and galleries to nature and private homes, and to media such as concept, action, performance, land art and video, such as the dissident video magazine Original Videojournal, which was secretly edited and copied on school equipment. 
- working within restrictive copyright or uncertain legal status: 1970s ephemeral media circulation in Cuba; low-resolution bootleg videos on UbuWeb; shadow and bootleg libraries. 
- constraints can be socio-economic: Soviet Constructivists using wood and scrap metal because other art supplies were scarce; 1970s artists using discarded materials to produce their work [quickly and cheaply](https://americanart.si.edu/blog/recycling-revolution-alternativemedia-chicanx-protest-art)
- ‘Free Furniture’ design ideas from the 1971 Steal This Book work by American political and social activist [Abbie Hoffman;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_This_Book)
- [Gambiarra in Brazil](https://www.makery.info/en/2015/03/31/gambiarra-la-culture-de-la-reparation/)
- [Jugaaḍ](), applied to concrete problems by repurposing objects and with limited resources, including the unexpected reconfiguration of media saturation in South Asia

## So, 

>what would it mean to address the urgency to the point of completely reconfiguring a practice? Is it dilettantism? Virtue signalling? Artivism? Or just a symbolic gesture?


	 
# Reflection

In a near vengeful tone the authors of this piece strip apart the term of maximalist [[On Techno-Aesthetics| techno-aesthetics]]: "Aesthetics, that are the manifestation of technologies driven by the myth of perpetual growth and infinite resources, aesthetics based on the everincreasing complexity and resource consumption of digital devices that seek to justify growth through self-referential legitimisation, regardless of necessity or ability to even function properly". They criticize corporate greed and the idea that "new is always better". Permacomputing, a combination of the words Permaculture and computing, seeks to be a practical framework that encourages limits and constraints in computer culture and creativity. In my own practices I've fallen into the trap of '[[The trap of mesmerizing aesthetics|mesmerizing aesthetics]]', creating beautiful (but shallow) 3D CGI artwork that goes into a similar direction of ignorant (towards climate crisis, overconsumption) maximisation. In the name of Permacomputing I am trying to reframe my practices into purposeful aesthetics with self-imposed constraints.

"Computationally minimal art (CMA) can be described as an algorithmic art that idealizes low computational complexity as a source of beauty." The simplicity of CMA in it's own process-making can be defined as an aesthetics. 
Like mentioned in the abstract: "... a different understanding of aesthetics, one that goes beyond the formal evaluation of how things look, but addresses how aesthetics can also be systems of relations, sensing and making sense that are already present in the process of making". 

This goes hand-in-hand with Simondons choice of a techno-asesthetic work: One that is functional, successful, and beautiful. And more so: The set of sensoric pleasure that goes with using a technically successful tool.
