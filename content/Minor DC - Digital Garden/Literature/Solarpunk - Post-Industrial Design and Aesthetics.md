## Introduction

A futurist aesthetic movement in response to renewed public concern for the environment and a seeming lack of reflection of that concern in much contemporary art and design.

- Eco/climate science fiction and Post-Industrial futurist literature

**Punk = Reactionary, and in opposition to both the naïve corporate utopianism that dominated the 20th century and the dystopianism that emerged, persisting to the present.**

- Activist, revolutionary narrative cultivating a positive, hopeful vision of a future rooted in technologies and culture of sustainability
- Transitioning to renewable-based infrastructure
- Collapse of Industrial Age paradigms; Hacking and repurporsing the detritus
- Maker-heroes create islands of self-sufficiency, seeding the culture of a new Post-Industrial era
- reverse-engineering artifacts of past cultures
- predominantly renewable energy powered world:

  - solar, wind, geothermal, sea (wave, current, tidal, ocean-thermal), hydropower, biofuels

- Being carbon neutral may not be sufficient in the future. The culture must strive toward being carbon NEGATIVE to reverse the warming trend produced by the industrial age

### Beginnings

1. Antihero Captain Nemo (Jules Verne, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea)

   - Indian victim of European colonialism, radicalised by the murder of his family by colonialists
   - appropriates and improves the technology of the colonialists power to fight back, and to create a model
     &rarr; Prototype tech-hero, turning the oppressors technology against them, repurposing it for the common

2. Cyberpunk narrative of the hacker-hero

   - radicalised by corporate/government oppressors
   - forced to retreat to a kind of underworld

3. Solarpunk narrative of the Maker-hero
   - reappropriate (green) technology suppressed by corporate and government interests for the sake of profiteering and social control
   - applying it to the salvation of a world facing environmental catastrophe and a more sustainable future
   - The Outquisition: Alex Steffan, Cory Doctorow &rarr; Imagined the emergence of a nomadic activist movement from eco-villages, hacker/makerspaces, Fab Labs, online communities

## Names

- [Ken Isaac](https://metropolismag.com/profiles/ken-isaacs-wanted-retool-way-we-live/): The Urban Nomad
  - Isaacs devised the concepts of user-built Living Structures, microhousing, ad the DIY Matrix building system that would inform much of what we now refer to as Maker and Solarpunk design.

## Places

Solar kitchen of [Auroville India](https://auroville.org/)

## Energy Production

- [Space Solar Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power)
- Even the latent energy of casual foot and vehicle traffic can potentially harvested, as well as the biochemical and thermal energy of human bodies and other organisms.
- Wired power grids most efficient

## Transportation

- Sailing vessels
- Airships
- [Ekranoplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-effect_vehicle#2000-)

## Organisation

- urban centres
- satellite communities
- eco-villages based on denser co-housing arrangements
- proto-arcologies
- impetus to reduce travel/shipping
- Basic income/alternative currencies
- Restoring land use to local food production and the natural habitat

> We commonly anticipate a future of increasing automation - decrying its likely negative impacts on society with the obsolescence of many jobs - but overlook the coincident evolution of that production technology itself. We are not just moving toward increasing automation but also the generalization of production, its localization with a shrinking scale and cost through robotization, and the globalization of production knowledge communicated digitally — what futurists often refer to with the terms 'Industry 4.0.'

> What is the difference between industrialization, automation, and robotization? Put simply, it's the transition of the information of design and technique toward increasing states of virtualization and thus portability. One might say, it's the transfer of production knowledge/skill from the human brain into the hardware of machines and then to portable, digital, forms.
>
> The fourth Industrial revolution is in the digitization of design and technique for the control of robotic production machines of increasingly multipurpose capability with shrinking scale and cost. With that comes a transition from speculative, capital-dependent, distant mass production to non-speculative, direct, and local production on-demand
> …knowledge is now in digital form, swapped out as needed and broadcast worldwide. We've completed an evolutionary circle from the originally local, generalized, direct human production of pre-industrial times to likewise local, generalized, and direct machine production, human skill now digitally unleashed from the confines of the brain to be made available everywhere. Hegemonies rooted in the exclusivity of ownership of the means and knowledge of production can be broken as that means — shrinking in physical scale and cost as it expands in capability — disperses into communities and even households.

> A new cultural paradigm is emergent; cosmo-localization/localism: Design and share globally — Make locally.
> It makes no sense anymore to ship bulky, fragile, wastefully packaged, finished goods long distances if you can simply transmit their designs for local production
>
> And this is why, in recent times, corporations have become so obsessed with the control of consumer behaviour and intellectual property. It's all they have left to maintain their old hegemonies in a world of dispersed digital production, where corporate designs must increasingly compete with open source ones coming from everywhere.

## Materials

- Return to older type of materials
- Eliminate packaging by structurally changing how we access goods

## Political and Economic Change

- Decline/collapse of Capitalism
- Emergence of Social-Democratic, Libertarian-Socialist, anarchistic systems
- Income disparity, growing detachment from mainstream culture

Global Resilience Movement
