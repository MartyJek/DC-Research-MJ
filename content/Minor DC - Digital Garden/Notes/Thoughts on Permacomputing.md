Coming from a computational extractive background that features playing around with the newest technological tools (e.g. photorealism, physics simulation in CG; anything-AI) the transitioning from the world of [[the trap of mesmerizing aesthetics|mesmerizing aesthetics]] into mindful aesthetics proves difficult. 

While trying to figure out in what way I can shift my direction I've come to understand that a radical switch to a Permacomputing (PMC) framework is possible <u>but hardly sensible.</u>

1. I do already own computationally powerful tools as my dispose, so why not use them?
	- I do not have to use their maximum performance, except in rare occasions
	- Using powerful equipment for projects with medium-low computational requirements leads to a longer longevity (source?)

2. My previous practices I've build on and the time used for said practices would possibly become obsolete, I feel not ready to start from scratch.

To be able to play with PMC principles and not land in a pit of inaction I want to enable a spectrum of Permacomputing.
