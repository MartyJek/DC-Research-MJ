Introduction: Critical Reading  
workshops in small groups of 4.  
We will collectively read texts related to Digital Craft, technology and systems thinking and making.  According to the Critical Reading method, we will look at **who** sends the message, **how** the message is filtered, through whose eyes we see the information, **why** the text was written and **for whom**. And finally, how you relate to the author’s position to the content, not only to the content. Writing from an observational perspective. Argumentation and substantiation of your opinion.

assignment:  
Bring an article about the discourse about a current technological system that you find interesting, Discuss this in your group. Look for artists, theorists or designers that radically work within the field of technology. Choose a technology/system you would like to work with.
