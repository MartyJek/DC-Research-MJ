quick follow up to the session:  
- next session is Wednesday 4 Oct 17:30 same room, I will bring the infamous chromebooks and we will see how far we get in de-googlifying them and turn them into machines to document the upcoming year  
- next session we will also discuss (while taking apart the chromebooks) these two texts: Do Artifacts Have Politics? from Langdon Winner (see pdf attached) + Origin Stories: Plantations, Computers, and Industrial Control from Meredith Whittaker (online text: [https://logicmag.io/supa-dupa-skies/origin-stories-plantations-computers-and-industrial-control/)](https://logicmag.io/supa-dupa-skies/origin-stories-plantations-computers-and-industrial-control/)). So read them in advance.
