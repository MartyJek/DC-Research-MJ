**Week 3 (37):  14 Sep. Context & Common Ground (Critical Reading 02)  
****AI  systems + bias**

How, by whom and for whom are technological systems programmed? Which societal consequences does this context have?  
We will discuss how prejudice is embedded and perpetuated in some technologies.

My work (up until now)

- motion graphics
- illustration
- 2d animation
- photography
- 3d animation
- photorealism
- permacomputing
- photorealism??? 
- non photorealistic 3D


Up until now I had the tendency to shift my focus on my art and design practices from one medium to the next. A sort of **multidisciplinary-jack-of-all-trades-master-of-non-ADHD-type situation.** 
As a kid I used to play video games and discovered motion graphics, I also started with illustration which made me want to animate and make my creations alive. After a detour towards analogue photography, which strengthened my compositional quality and helped me acquiring a cinematic eye I did some more 2D animation, but quickly discovered the powers of 3D animation, which would allow me to create my imaginative environments in minutes. I also discovered the powers of proceduralism: A modelling technique that works with maths and visual coding to create non-destructive 3D systems instead of 3D objects. While continuously studying and working within Blender, my 3D program of choice, I fell into a trap: A trap I've heard the first time from Aymeric Mansoux in a Permacomputing workshop
Permacomputing is a discipline derived from design practices of permaculture, the opposite of our industrial monocultures that feed the planet, it's a broad, complex topic that tries to unveil how to make computing more sustainable, turning waste and and constraints into possibilities. The trap I fell into is called: Mesmerizing aesthetics. As I deepened my practice I became fascinated of photorealism and computer-intensive simulations, but like the Kardashians their essence is hollow. Except grabbing bursts of attention there is no deeper meaning in beauty.
And I realised quickly that I dont want to become a 3D animator making my living doing shoe advertisements?  
So right now I'm working with constraints in 3D art and am asking myself the question if Permacomputing and 3D
