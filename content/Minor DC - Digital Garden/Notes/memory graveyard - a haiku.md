>Here or in the clouds <br>
A space filled with memories <br>
What do they matter?


___
Either on the phone or in the Cloud exists a space full of old memories. Thousands of moving or still images, memes, vacation photos, are sitting in a virtual[^1] space, ready to be forgotten. Many of them even reach the Cloud, as if they are of such importance that they need to be of 24/7 availability on all of your devices. Who says that? Isn't it the usual suspects, trying to sell you something you don't need?


[^1]: Virtual space = Physical micro-space on the phone/rented storage in a data-center
