#### Example of an attempt to be transparent about the consequences of design in the age of late capitalism

>presentation of a way to make a somehow ethical bill of material for your project (taking example from a small boutique synth project)

**What this page is covering is essentially a mix of**  

- Bill of Materials  
	[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials)  

-  Software Bill of Materials  
	[https://www.promenadesoftware.com/blog/create-a-software-bill-of-materials](https://www.promenadesoftware.com/blog/create-a-software-bill-of-materials)  

-  Ethical sourcing

- Energy calculation  
	  of the work but also of the energy that was required to produce it

#### A (sort of) template for navigating a project as a network of interdependent things

We could try the following :)

**The making (process/fabrication/production/etc)**

  
   - Labour  
        - how many ppl  
        - how much work (hours, days)  
        - costs (fee, wages, internship, free labour)

   - Tools used during the making  
        - list of software (incl. manufacturer, license type, online/offline, owned/rented/borrowed)  
        - list of hardware (incl manufacturer, owned/rented/borrowed)

  
   - Energy consumption for the making  
        - intro to 2000watt society  
            - [https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/2000-watt-society](https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/2000-watt-society)  
        - estimate of energy consumption used during the making  
            - where to draw the line?

**The outcome  (result/work/product/etc)**

**(specify if something is NEW or repurposed)**

   - Bill of material with country of origin  
        - not just component but also materials  
        - possibly information about labour laws of this country  
        - [https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale)

   - Software bill of material

   - Operational requirements  
        - energy consumption  
        - third party services and infrastructure (an API?)  
        - user data management (TOS, GDPR, dark patterns, etc)

   - License for your work

   - Technical documentation
	- published or not? or shared?
	- can it be repaired  
	- can it be reproduced  
	- can it appropriated  
	- can it be improved  

  

#### **Assignment**

- fill the template for your project (try to be as detailed as possible, yes it's difficult)

- filling the template can be in the form of making list, diagrams, or maps, or a combination of these things

- try to spot the parts that could be improved based on the pmc principles, do you have an idea on how to improve such parts of your project?

- is the template missing an important element? Feel free to add it!

- if something needs clarification, email me a.l.mansoux@hr.nl



##### 10,000h rule by Malcom Gladwell (Outliers)

##### Laptop

idle 
>Low brightness = 15 Watts
>	high = 20 Watts

CPU on
85-95 Watts

GPU on
105-140 Watts (Brave browser)

160 Watts - Peak 175 Watts (Blender)

Computer

Off (Socket on): 
ca. 7 Watts 

On:
Idle: ca 110 Watts

Browser: hardware acceleration on: 200 Watts (off: -50-100 Watts)

Surfing: 130 Watts

Youtube 140-150 Watts

>Hardware acceleration -20-30 Watts??


Blender

180 Watts - Viewport rotation (preview shading)

350 Watts - Viewport rotation (rendered shading)

+500 Watts - Rendering scene

## Conclusion

![[breakdown-watts.gif]]

>Average of 250 Watts/h results in 2500kWh during 2.6/5.4 years of becoming a Blender master

>Netherlands average per capita = 55k kWh/year 

<u>Questions</u>

- What does this say about how I can responsibly become a Blender master?
- How can I compensate my energy consumption from rendering?
- From the chart: Can I simply compensate my 3D by not ever driving a car and not use air travel?
- How can i breakdown my total energy consumption to be able to put my 3D-work energy consumption into perspective?
