# About 

THIS IS FINE.  
Invite-only, secret location under the volcano.  
  
It should not come as a surprise that discussions around environmental issues, ecology, biodiversity and climate justice are becoming more and more present within WdKA. At the moment however these discussions remain isolated from each other. This currently prevents a more wide-spread and thorough engagement across the majors, minors, stations, practices and different bachelor and master initiatives. We are a small group thinking that it is time that we start talking to each other to consolidate works and research done on these matters. THIS IS FINE will take advantage of the Research Festival to gather representatives of such of these initiatives, and investigate how this consolidation can materialise. This session is invite-only, but if you have not hear from us yet and believe that your work and research have been overlooked while we tried to map like-minded initiatives, then first of all, apologies, and second, please get in touch with us! a.van.meer@hr.nl and a.l.mansoux@hr.nl
