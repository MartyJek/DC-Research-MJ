From [[Permaculture]] + Computing

> Can there be a place for computer and network technology in a world where humans contribute to the well-being of the biosphere rather than destroy it?

> Understandability is aesthetics, virtual does not mean immaterial and doing things with less is not *a return to the past*. We want to investigate what a permacomputing way of life could be, and what sort of transformative computational culture and aesthetics it could bring forward.

# Design Principles

#### Care For Life

- Care for the earth, care for the people
- Low-power systems
- [[off-the-grid]]
- Minimise artificial energy, fossil fuel and mineral resource-use

---

#### Care for the Chips

- [[Lifespan maximization]]
- Respect the quirks and peculiarities of what already exists and repair what can be repaired.
- Create new devices from [salvaged components](https://permacomputing.net/salvage_computing/).
- Support [local time-sharing](https://permacomputing.net/time-sharing/) within your community in order to avoid buying redundant stuff.
- Push the industry towards **[Planned longevity](http://permacomputing.net/planned_longevity/)**.
- [Design for disassembly](http://permacomputing.net/Design_for_disassembly/).

---

 [[Keep it small]]

---

#### Hope for the best, prepare for the worst

- resilient and collapse-tolerant
- [open to positive and utopian possibilities](Solarpunk). Experiment with new ideas and have grand visions.
- [Design for descent](http://permacomputing.net/design_for_descent/).

---

#### Keep it flexible

> Flexibility means that a system can be used in a vast array of purposes, including ones it was not primarily designed for.

- smallness - simplicity - flexibility

---

#### Build on a solid ground

> "Grow roots to a solid ground". Learn things that last, enrich your local tradition, know the history of everything.

- Appreciate mature technologies, clear ideas and well-understood theories when building something that is intended to last.
- Avoid unreliable [dependencies](http://permacomputing.net/dependency/)
- It is possible to support several target platforms. In case of lasting programs, one of these should be a [bedrock platform](http://permacomputing.net/bedrock_platform/) that does not change and therefore does not cause [software rot](http://permacomputing.net/software_rot/).

#### Amplify awareness

Computers were invented to assist people in their cognitive processes. "Intelligence amplification" was a good goal, but intelligence may also be used narrowly and blindly. It may therefore be a better idea to amplify awareness.

- Awareness means awareness of whatever is concretely going on in the world/environment but also awareness of how things work and how they situate in their contexts (cultural, historical, biological etc).
- You don't need to twiddle with everything in order to understand it. [[Yin and Yang hacking]] emphasizes observation.
- It may also often be a good idea to amplify the computer's awareness of its physical surroundings with things like sensors.

#### Expose everything

As an extension of "amplify awareness": Don't hide information!

- Keep everything open, modifiable and flexible.
- Share your [source code](http://permacomputing.net/FLOSS/) and design philosophies.
- **State visualization**: Make the computer visualize/auralize its internal state as well as whatever it knows about the state of its physical environment. Regard this visualization/auralization as a background landscape: facilitate observation but don't steal the attention. Also, don't use too much computing resources for this (updating a full-screen background landscape tens of times per second is a total overkill)

#### Respond to changes

Computing systems should adapt to the changes in their operating environments (especially in relation to energy and heat). 24/7 availability of all parts of the system should not be required, and neither should a constant operating performance (e.g. networking speed).

- In a long term, software and hardware systems should not get obsoleted by changing needs and conditions. New software can be written even for old computers, old software can be modifed to respond to new needs, and new devices can be built from old components. Avoid both [software rot](http://permacomputing.net/software_rot/) and [retro](http://permacomputing.net/retro/)computing.

#### Everything has a place

Be part of your local energy/matter circulations, ecosystems and cultures. Cherish locality, [avoid centralization](http://permacomputing.net/decentralization/). Strengthen the local roots of the technology you use and create.

While operating locally and at present, be aware of the entire world-wide context your work takes place in. This includes the historical context several decades to the past and the future. Understanding the past(s) is the key for envisioning the possible futures.

- Nothing is "universal". Even computers, "universal calculators" that can be readapted to any task, are full of quirks that stem from the cultures that created them. Don't take them as the only way things can be, or as the most "rational" or "advanced" way.
- Every system, no matter how ubiquitous or "universal" it is, is only a tiny speckle in a huge ocean of possibilities. Try to understand the entire possibility space in addition to the individual speckles you have concrete experience about.
- **[Appreciate diversity](http://permacomputing.net/Technological_diversity/)**, avoid [monoculture](http://permacomputing.net/monoculture/). But remember that [?](http://permacomputing.net/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&from=Principles&page=standard)standards also have an important place.
- Strict utilitarianism impoverishes. Uselessness also has an important place, so appreciate it.
- You may also read this principle as: **There is a place of everything**. Nothing is obsolete or irrelevant. Even if they lose their original meaning, programmable systems may be readapted to new purposes they were not originally designed for. Think about technology as a rhizome rather than a "highway of progress and constant obsolescence".
- There is a place for both slow and fast, both gradual and one-shot processes. Don't look at all things through the same glasses.


# Theory

## [[Permacomputing Aesthetics|Aesthetics]] from a perspective on how we are looking at things, not only from how things are looking

_Small is beautiful_: anti-[[maximalism]]

- low-detail, low complexity, lo-fi, low graphics
- [[Demoscene]] 
	- The dominant approach on the [demoscene](https://permacomputing.net/demoscene/) is optimalism, or "capped maximalism". It often proves that mass appeal can be reached despite tight limitations, **but the aesthetic basis is still maximalist – fitting a maximal amount of content within the limits, the more the better.**


> Ideally, the low complexity itself can be a source of beauty: things can look good *because* of their smallness, not *despite* it. If this succeeds really well, even the most mainstreamy viewer won't be longing for more resolution or detail.


> [!info] In video games, not the fidelity is important but the enjoyment of the game itself.

### Transgression and immersion

**Transgression** and **immersion** are two oppositional ways to creatively relate to constraints, especially in the kind of digital art forms that appreciate constraints (chip music, [[Demoscene]], [pixel art](http://permacomputing.net/pixel_art/)).

Transgression is yang: it attempts to "break" or "push" the boundaries; to get a system to do something it is not supposed to be able to do; to find new things by exploring the unexplored possibilities of a given platform. The characteristic sounds and looks of a system (such as the 1:1 square wave in chip music, or clearly visible pixel boundaries) are often considered unrefined and unwanted.

Immersion is yin: instead of breaking away from the typical and unrefined, it takes it as the basis to build on. The 1:1 square wave is now very much wanted. The individual characteristics of a system are appreciated and explored ever deeper.

# Practice

**From [[Permacomputing Aesthetics]]**:

> In practice, permacomputing exists as two intertwined strands: first, an incentive to reuse and repurpose existing computer technology and materials to create new works; and second, a list of continuously evolving design principles, to guide that very reuse and repurposing, but also to inform the development of new software and hardware when reuse and repurposing are not possible or relevant.

>Permacomputing is a practical critique on today's ICT culture.

# Permacomputing in the Arts - Workshop 16/03/23

#### About

The permacomputing in the arts workshop series is part of a postdoc research from [ugrnm](https://permacomputing.net/ugrnm/)exploring to what degree the concept of permacomputing can be broadened and applied to critically revised, sustainable ways of making computing part of art and design education and professional practice. This research will be embedded in the design curriculum of Willem de Kooning Academy, Rotterdam, NL, **focused on redefining the role of artists and designers to contribute to future modes of more sustainable organisation and production.**

It is part of a larger research and effort to develop new curricula to support artists and designers materialise and contribute to alternative modes of organisation and production based on strong ecological and cooperative/collaborative values. It seeks to reflect on, experiment and engage with such alternatives while bringing the urgency of the climate crisis and climate justice to art and design education, while remaining critical of techno-solutionism and the language of circularity and sustainability.

#### Issue

For the past decades, art academies have expanded their curricula from traditional fine art practices, such as painting and sculpture, to work with computer technology. It can take the form of an installation, a performance, a graphic design, a data visualisation, and will often use computer technology for the making, publishing, and circulation of the work. However, ==artists and designers are not educated to assess to which degree their practice could be environmentally problematic and extractive.== This is an issue by itself and gets worse once entering both speculative and applied practices that have the ambition to engage with environmental issues.

For instance, a graphic designer can be commissioned to program an interactive website to explain the energy impact of digital media. If the website is programmed in a way that requires resource-intensive computing in data centres and drains the batteries of the visitor's phone or laptop, then instead of being an exemplary and generative contribution, it risks to remain symbolic, or in a performative contradiction to its stated goal. At worst, it may even be an alibi for environmentally harmful practices and technologies. This is a problem because it seriously weakens and undermines the interdependent relation between the cultural sector, art and design education, and policymaking. It is also a missed opportunity to showcase forward-looking practices that could be both creative and more sustainable.

==Permacomputing could promote a transition from a system where creative practitioners use the latest digital tools and media, regardless of environmental consequences, to a more strategic system in which digital tools and media of all generations, are carefully combined, crafted and used to form a less extractive practice.==
