# Abstract 

	“On Techno-Aesthetics” is a letter by Gilbert Simondon to Jacques Derrida about the foundation of the Collège International de Philosophie (CIPH). It is dated July 3rd, 1982, and it is handwritten on letterhead paper from the Université René Descartes. The letter was published in Issue 12 of Papiers, a collection directed by CIPH’s program directors.2 The issue also features a typewritten text by Simondon on educational reform, which is not included here.

If our fundamental aim is to revitalize contemporary philosophy, we should first of all think of interfaces, and nothing should be excluded a priori. There is no reference to religious thought and practice in your project. Why? We should also take into account aesthetic thought and practice, regardless of whether the latter has a reflexive component. Why not think about founding and perhaps even provisionally axiomatizing an aesthetico-technics or techno-aesthetics? In Valéry’s version of Socrates’ dialogue with Phaedrus, the architect Eupaulinos says the following: 
>“Whereas passersby merely see an elegant chapel, I see the exact proportions of a girl from Corinth whom I happily loved.”
# Reflection

Simondon exemplifies his definition on techno-aesthetics with multiple architectural works. He defines a techno-aesthetic work as: perfectly functional, successful, and beautiful. "It’s technical and aesthetic at the same time: aesthetic because it’s technical, and technical because it’s aesthetic. There is intercategorial fusion."

Some objects have an extra layer of beauty by giving a sense of well-being through sensorimotoric pleasure.

>That said, contemplation is not techno-aesthetics’ primary category. It’s in usage, in action, that it becomes something orgasmic, a tactile means and motor of stimulation. When a nut that is stuck becomes unstuck, one experiences a motoric pleasure, a certain instrumentalized joy, a communication--mediated by the tool--with the thing on which the tool is working

>Aesthetics is not only, nor first and foremost, the sensation of the “consumer” of the work of art. It is also, and more originally so, the set of sensations, more or less rich, of the artists themselves: it’s about a certain contact with matter that is being transformed through work.
